## 🎯 Purpose of the Website

A personal academic website serves as a centralized profile: a brief biography, list of publications, projects, teaching activities, presentations, and contact details. The **Hugo Academic** ecosystem evolved into **Wowchemy**, and later into **Hugo Blox**, maintaining its focus on academic content and a “block-based” page-building approach without programming.

## 🧱 Structure of the Website

- **Home (About):** photo, short bio, research interests, profile links. Academic/Wowchemy templates come with pre-configured sections for this.  
- **Publications:** article cards with types, abstracts, DOI/ArXiv/SSRN, BibTeX, and filters.  
- **Teaching:** courses, syllabi, lecture materials.  
- **Projects:** research descriptions, grants, and open-source work.  
- **Talks:** conferences, seminars, slides, and recordings.  
- **Blog/Notes:** news, preprints, short updates.  
- **Contact:** form, e-mail, social media, map.  

The ready-to-use “Academic Resume” starter templates and demos show what it looks like out of the box.

## 🔧 No-Code Structure Customization

The platform uses **blocks** (visual sections) and theme parameters: color schemes, fonts, icons, menus, and metadata. Most configuration is done via settings and content files, while documents and pages are added as “cards” in the corresponding sections.  

- **Theme and palette:** choose and fine-tune color schemes, dark/light mode.  
- **Menu and navigation:** top menu items, breadcrumbs, section shortcuts.  
- **Content modules:** bio, publications, courses, projects — enabled and rearranged as needed.

## 🚀 Publishing the Website

There are quick deployment options without manual building:

- **GitHub Pages / GitLab Pages:** repository with a starter template and automatic publishing.  
- **Netlify and similar services:** connect to the repository and automatically rebuild the site on each commit.

## 📚 Publications and Open Science

The “Academic”/“Hugo Blox” template is optimized for academic profiles: supports publication types, tags, DOI links, citation imports, and metrics display — making it convenient for showcasing research and open-access works.

## 🎨 Personalization and Best Practices

- **Consistent tone and visual style:** covers, icons, typography.  
- **Clear URL and metadata structure:** correct titles, descriptions, language settings.  
- **Focus on relevance:** keep “Publications” and “News” sections updated; archive outdated events.  
- **Accessibility and speed:** minimize heavy images; use previews.  
- **Profiles and integrations:** add ORCID/Google Scholar/GitHub to connect the site with academic activity.
