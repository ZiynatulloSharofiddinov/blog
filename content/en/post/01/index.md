## ðŸ“Œ Week from June 25 to July 1

The week was spent in full concentration mode â€” the exam session was in full swing. The exams in economics and computer science turned out to be more challenging than expected: I had to dedicate a lot of time to reviewing lectures and solving past yearsâ€™ problems.  

The algorithms exam was especially memorable â€” one of the tasks involved code optimization, and the solution came literally a couple of minutes before the end. The adrenaline was off the charts!  

Despite the fatigue, thereâ€™s a real sense of satisfaction from the work done. Only a couple more subjects left â€” and then I can finally relax.
