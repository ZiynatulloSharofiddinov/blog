## ðŸ“Œ Week from July 23 to July 29

The vacation is reaching its midpoint, and I decided to do a bit of preparation for the upcoming semester. I made a list of subjects to be studied and found several online courses to deepen my knowledge in databases and analytics.  

I also disassembled my laptop, cleaned the cooling system, and updated some software â€” now the equipment is ready for new workloads.  

Little by little, I can feel the anticipation of returning to the university atmosphere.
