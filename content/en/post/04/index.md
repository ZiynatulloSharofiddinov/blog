## ðŸ“Œ Week from July 16 to July 22

This week was spent outdoors â€” my friends and I went out of town. Tents, a campfire, evening conversations, and a starry sky â€” exactly what was needed after an intense academic year.  

During the day, we swam in the lake and went boating, and in the evening, we experimented with a bit of campfire cooking.  

Trips like this help to reset and return to tasks with renewed energy.
