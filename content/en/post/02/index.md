## ðŸ“Œ Week from July 2 to July 8

The exam session has finally ended, and the long-awaited summer vacation has begun. The very first thing I did was simply sleep in without an alarm.  

I met up with friends in the park â€” we walked around and recalled the funniest moments of the past semester. The weather is perfect â€” itâ€™s the best time for walks and trips out of town.  

Iâ€™ve planned a few small programming projects for July to stay in shape, but for now, Iâ€™m just enjoying my free time.
