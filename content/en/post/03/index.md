## ðŸ“Œ Week from July 9 to July 15

This week, I started working on a small project â€” a chatbot for automating simple tasks. Iâ€™m using Python and a library for message processing.  

At the same time, Iâ€™m reading a book on algorithms that I didnâ€™t manage to fully cover during the semester. Itâ€™s fascinating to see how the theory studied at the university is now applied to real-world problems.  

Even though the vacation is in full swing, I try to dedicate a couple of hours a day to studying and practice.
