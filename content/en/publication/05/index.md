## ðŸ“Œ What is Digital Minimalism?

Digital minimalism is an approach to technology use in which we keep only those digital tools and devices that truly provide value and help us achieve our goals.  
The essence of the method is to eliminate unnecessary apps, notifications, and information noise to focus on what matters most.

## ðŸ›  Core Principles

- **Mindfulness** â€” every digital tool should have a clear purpose and deliver tangible benefits.  
- **Reducing distractions** â€” minimize notifications, redundant apps, and subscriptions.  
- **Prioritizing real communication** â€” technology should assist but not replace in-person interaction.  
- **Quality over quantity** â€” itâ€™s better to use one reliable tool than a dozen mediocre ones.
